/**
 * PP1: Tenvyr-owned execution workspace lease for one Team Run.
 *
 * The concrete path every local coding-runtime child of the run executes
 * against (source workspace itself for `shared`; an isolated Git worktree
 * for `git-worktree`), with a durable recoverable lifecycle. External Git
 * mutations are NEVER transactionally atomic with PostgreSQL: the ALLOCATING
 * row commits BEFORE any `git worktree` mutation, READY is only ever written
 * after the worktree demonstrably exists, and reconciliation fails
 * interrupted allocations closed. UNIQUE(ownerRunId) makes concurrent
 * ownership of the same lease impossible at the database level.
